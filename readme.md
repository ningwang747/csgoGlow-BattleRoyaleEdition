# Project csgoGlow, a 100% FREE and OPEN-SOURCE wallhack for OSX

**Thanks to @gabsens and @e-retailer’s contribution to this project**

### Hello World
if you are newbie and have never use Xcode, go and watch @gabsens’s [Video at Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefIiBg2HKU)

don't get scammed by people trying to make money off of this hack!

### How to run?
clone it from github and run it with **ROOT**.

### What if CS:GO updates?
Nothing. Since there is pattern scanning implemented you don't need to update any Offset-Pointers.

### Is it safe?
Maybe, depends on Gaben

### More features?
No! We won't implement aimbot, bunnyhop or other stuff to it. This is just a native CS:GO Wallhack.

But you can refer to https://csgoglow.hipchat.com/invite/646884/2885f39b8a11953a3039070fe8325713 signup and ask questions about other features. The issue Tracker should be an Issue tracker.

## About `Internal`:
sorry for another delay, there some new trouble.
